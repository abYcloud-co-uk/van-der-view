# Project Overview — van-der-view

> **van-der-view** is an **open-source, headless React developer library**: the
> bridge between an AI agent (LLM chatbot) and the Mol\* 3D molecular renderer.
> `pnpm install`, drop into any React app that has an agent chatbot; the agent
> controls the 3D view in real time via a lightweight standardized JSON command
> schema. (Design baseline locked 2026-06-18, src: raw/0003.)

## Goal

An LLM chatbot emits small standardized JSON commands — *"highlight residue X"*,
*"zoom to ligand Y"*, *"toggle WebXR mode"* — and the library translates them into
live changes in a complex Web 3D molecular view.

## Audience & boundary (decided)

- **Audience:** third-party developers embedding it into their own AI/bio apps.
  The parent `aws_protein_project` is **out of scope** for this library (src: raw/0003).
- **Boundary = "library + agent glue":** ships the renderer mount/control, the JSON
  command schema, ready-made LLM tool definitions, and the executor. **No chat UI**
  — that's the developer's (src: raw/0003). See [[agent-command-flow]].
- **Input modality (incl. voice/VR) is the host's.** In immersive XR the DOM chat is
  gone, so the user talks to the agent by voice — but voice/STT/agent-loop are the
  host's, like the chat UI. van-der-view only guarantees commands apply mid-XR and
  exposes `viewer.xr` state/events; entering XR needs a user gesture, so it can't be
  voice-triggered (src: raw/0006). See [[molstar-webxr]].

## Constraints (the hard requirements)

| # | Constraint | Implication |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Headless** | No imposed UI chrome. Mol\*'s `PluginContext` + `initViewerAsync`, not `createPluginUI`. See [[molstar-api]]. |
| 2 | **Configurable** | Enabled commands, defaults, data source resolver are host-configurable (`MolViewConfig`). |
| 3 | **Framework-agnostic React** | Next.js, Vite, TanStack, Remix; browser/WebGL-only ⇒ client-only. See [[headless-react]]. |
| 4 | **Standardized lightweight JSON schema** | The agent↔renderer contract, driven by structured tool-calling. See [[command-schema]]. |
| 5 | **Real-time control** | Commands apply incrementally to a live scene, not full re-renders. |

## Technology decisions (locked)

- **Renderer:** [[molstar-api]] (Mol\*), reused off-the-shelf. Direct dependency on
  `molstar` (not wrapping `pdbe-molstar`).
- **WebXR:** native to Mol\* (`canvas3d.xr`); `toggle-xr` is a v1.1 command. See [[molstar-webxr]].
- **Command transport:** structured **tool-calling**; agent targets our schema, not
  raw Mol\*. Executor is provider-agnostic; adapters are per-provider (v1 = Anthropic,
  OpenAI/Codex placeholder). See [[agent-command-flow]] and [[command-schema]].
- **v1 commands:** load-structure, highlight, focus, get-scene-context, reset-camera.
- **Integration deltas (from the first real target, src: raw/0005):** `load-structure`
  adds an `inline` source and routes all loading through a host `resolveStructure`
  hook (auth/storage stays in the host); the executor can **attach to a host-owned
  Mol\* plugin**; the developer's LLM call may live in their **backend** (thin-client
  path). See [[agent-command-flow]] and [[command-schema]].

## Naming note

"van der" evokes **van der Waals** radii/forces — fitting for a molecular tool.
⚠️ unverified (recorded as a reasonable read).

## Open questions
- **Testing strategy** — designed; see [[testing-strategy]] (remaining: confirm Node-side `Structure` build).
- Packaging details: peer-dep on `molstar` vs bundle; one component vs hooks-only.
- Pin which Mol\* `5.x` to target.
- Server-side vs client-side MVS construction (for the v1.1 `load-scene`).
